Hey, there! long time no see ah? I forgot to tell you that now I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning blokchain and its security. Recently, I tried to compete in MoveCTF which was organized by MoveBit, Ottersec and ChainFlag, sponsored by Mysten Labs(Sui). From the name we can understand that this ctf is conducted on Move langauge and the platform was Sui blockchain.
I&amp;rsquo;m actually very new to Move (known for 3 days before CTF).</description></item><item><title>CSAW Quals 2022</title><link>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/csaw_quals_2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 07:34:48 +0830</pubDate><guid>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/csaw_quals_2022/</guid><description>Sup?!
