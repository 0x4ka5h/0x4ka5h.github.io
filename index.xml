From the name we can understand that this ctf is conducted on Move langauge and the platform was Sui blockchain.
I&amp;rsquo;m actually very new to Move (known for 3 days before CTF). Meanwhile, I&amp;rsquo;m learning Aptos, later shockingly known that this ctf was based on sui blockchain. Literally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been hurried up and learn sui in the period of ctf and try to compete.</description></item><item><title>The Ethernaut</title><link>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/ethernaut/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 07:34:48 +0830</pubDate><guid>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/ethernaut/</guid><description>Sup!?
Hey, there! long time no see ah? I forgot to tell you that now I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning blockchain security related stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m able to solved some challenges from Ethernaut CTF and I took previous writeups help to understand remaining.
Some of my seniors @S3v3ru5*, @D1r3w0lf, @Sud0u53r and @S1r1u5* are doing in blockchain security and suggested me to solve these challenges to learn about basic bugs in solidity. Unlike web2 CTFs, Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based and played in Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).</description></item><item><title>CSAW Quals 2022</title><link>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/csaw_quals_2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 07:34:48 +0830</pubDate><guid>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/csaw_quals_2022/</guid><description>Sup?!
Hey, there! After a bit gap, I‚Äôm back with CSAW CTF in Qualifers round problems, I played this CTF along with Invaders team and ended up at #5 in India region. I solved 2 Misc challenges ‚Äì catTheFlag, ezMaze.
catTheFlag Well,one moment please. We can catch up after CSAW finals.</description></item><item><title>InvaderCTF writeups</title><link>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/invaderctf-writeups/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 07:34:48 +0830</pubDate><guid>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/invaderctf-writeups/</guid><description>Introduction Hello mate, Sup?
Long time, no see ah? Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I&amp;rsquo;m coming. Here we go, Our new blog but this time with a different topic üôÉ. Me, entering the world of CTFs and Application security. Playing ‚ÄúInvaderCTF‚Äù is my first step toward the path that I have chosen. And, at the end of the day, it‚Äôs a ü•≥BANG! I&amp;rsquo;m able to secure my position in the Top 3.
Actually, I&amp;rsquo;m studying at RGUKT.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/about/</guid><description>Still learning weights ^_~ come again and check for checkpoints!</description></item><item><title>Depth Estimation of a Pothole on Roads</title><link>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/depthestimationofapothole/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 07:34:48 +0830</pubDate><guid>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/depthestimationofapothole/</guid><description>Introduction I knew you guys can&amp;rsquo;t bear for long period for my presence with our new blogs. That&amp;rsquo;s why this time I came up with a real-time developed project which is submitted to the Government of India.
Visit Hackathon website A hackathon was conducted overall in India. After, 3 rounds of filtering we got selected for the semi-final round based on the prototype presentation. And we cleared that round with our prototype and as a result, we were gone into the finals.</description></item><item><title>Vehicle Accident Detection Using FPGA</title><link>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/vehicleaccidentdetectionusingfpga/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 07:34:48 +0830</pubDate><guid>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/vehicleaccidentdetectionusingfpga/</guid><description>Introduction Have you seen my previous post? If yes, I know you will definitely come here to see my new post.. üòå. what if your answer is No? Then you will definitely come here next timeü•≤.
What&amp;rsquo;s new this timeüôÑ?&amp;hellip; Vehicle Accident detection using FPGA üòÆ‚Äçüí®.
Ew? FPGAüò¶? What&amp;rsquo;s that? Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are semiconductor devices that are based around a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected via programmable interconnects.</description></item><item><title>Driver Drowsiness Detection</title><link>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/driverdrowsinessdetection/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 07:34:48 +0830</pubDate><guid>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/driverdrowsinessdetection/</guid><description>Hi guys,How are you? I hope you guys are fine and missing my blogs so much.. Hah!!
This time I coming with a new topic mostly based on Image processing and ComputerVision technologies. Its sounds little bit different than previous blog, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? In this blog, we address a drowsy driver alert system that has been developed using such a technique in which the Video Stream Processing (VSP) is analyzed by eye blink concept through an Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Euclidean distance of the eye.</description></item><item><title>Image Restoration Using GAN's Part-1</title><link>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/imagrestorationusinggans_1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Sep 2020 07:34:48 +0830</pubDate><guid>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/imagrestorationusinggans_1/</guid><description>What is GAN&amp;rsquo;s? Generative Adversarial Networks GAN&amp;rsquo;s are one of the most interesting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A generator learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator learns to tell real images apart from fakes. Case: I have read that, in most of the cases Doctors may face issues while they are making decisions over CT scanned Images because of Gaussian Noise and making electronic Noise (unwanted disturbance in a signal which is reflected in output).</description></item><item><title>Image Restoration Using GAN's Part-2</title><link>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/imagerestorationusinggans_2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Sep 2020 07:34:48 +0830</pubDate><guid>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/imagerestorationusinggans_2/</guid><description>Lets continue the part-1 ^_^ ;).., We already know that what GAN&amp;rsquo;s are and why they are used. Well, not really. GANs belong to implicit learning methods. In explicit learning models, the model learns its weights directly from the data. whereas in implicit learning, the model learns without the data directly passing through the network. so it is reinforcement learning? Not really Hah..,!
As of now,we already discussed that GAN&amp;rsquo;s have two model, and two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process.</description></item><item><title>2048 with Python</title><link>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/2048withpython/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:34:48 +0830</pubDate><guid>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/2048withpython/</guid><description>Introduction Hey matesüòä. How are you? Hope you all begin well. Do you know 2048 game? Yeah! Of course, everyone knew that. Ok then, Let me create it on my own ü•≤.
Why I&amp;rsquo;m doing this GameBoard? Actually, One of my seniors in my college asked me to do this for their exam. That senior need to submit this GameBoard code which is written in python to get selected for InterView in OffCampus placement.</description></item><item><title>A Simple Video Call App with python Sockets</title><link>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/simplevideocallapp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 07:34:48 +0830</pubDate><guid>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/posts/simplevideocallapp/</guid><description>Introduction Hey matesüòä.

Why we are here? To make some fun? üòï! No, But we&amp;rsquo;re here to learn something new in a funny way. Funny while learningüòí? Yeah!.,
By the way, What&amp;rsquo;s the new thing? Guess? ü§îü§î.. How to copy some code from StackOverflow easily using python?</description></item></channel></rss>
