From the name we can understand that this ctf is conducted on Move langauge and the platform was Sui blockchain.
I&amp;rsquo;m actually very new to Move (known for 3 days before CTF). Meanwhile, I&amp;rsquo;m learning Aptos, later shockingly known that this ctf was based on sui blockchain. Literally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been hurried up and learn sui in the period of ctf and try to compete.</description></item></channel></rss>
