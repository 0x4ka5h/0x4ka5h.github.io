Generative Adversarial Networks GAN&amp;rsquo;s are one of the most interesting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A generator learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator learns to tell real images apart from fakes. Case: I have read that, in most of the cases Doctors may face issues while they are making decisions over CT scanned Images because of Gaussian Noise and making electronic Noise (unwanted disturbance in a signal which is reflected in output).</description></item><item><title>Image Restoration Using GAN's Part-2</title><link>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/en/posts/imagerestorationusinggans_2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Sep 2020 07:34:48 +0830</pubDate><guid>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/en/posts/imagerestorationusinggans_2/</guid><description>Lets continue the part-1 ^_^ ;).., We already know that what GAN&amp;rsquo;s are and why they are used. Well, not really. GANs belong to implicit learning methods. In explicit learning models, the model learns its weights directly from the data. whereas in implicit learning, the model learns without the data directly passing through the network. so it is reinforcement learning? Not really Hah..,!
As of now,we already discussed that GAN&amp;rsquo;s have two model, and two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process.</description></item></channel></rss>
