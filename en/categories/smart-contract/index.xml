From the name we can understand that this ctf is conducted on Move langauge and the platform was Sui blockchain.
I&amp;rsquo;m actually very new to Move (known for 3 days before CTF). Meanwhile, I&amp;rsquo;m learning Aptos, later shockingly known that this ctf was based on sui blockchain. Literally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been hurried up and learn sui in the period of ctf and try to compete.</description></item><item><title>The Ethernaut</title><link>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/en/posts/ethernaut/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 07:34:48 +0830</pubDate><guid>https://0x4ka5h.github.io/en/posts/ethernaut/</guid><description>Sup!?
Hey, there! long time no see ah? I forgot to tell you that now I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning blockchain security related stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m able to solved some challenges from Ethernaut CTF and I took previous writeups help to understand remaining.
Some of my seniors @S3v3ru5*, @D1r3w0lf, @Sud0u53r and @S1r1u5* are doing in blockchain security and suggested me to solve these challenges to learn about basic bugs in solidity. Unlike web2 CTFs, Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based and played in Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).</description></item></channel></rss>
